# AirBnB: New York City rental market data visualization 

AirBnB New York City Rental Market - Data Visualization and dashboard using Tableau 
Airbnb is a global online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts offering lodging in homes, apartments, or unique accommodations. Founded in 2008, it has revolutionized the way people book and experience accommodations, providing a diverse range of options in thousands of destinations worldwide. Airbnb has become a popular choice for both travelers seeking personalized stays and hosts looking to monetize their properties.
