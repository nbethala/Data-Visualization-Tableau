# AirBnB: New York City rental market data visualization 

AirBnB New York City Rental Market - Data Visualization and dashboard using Tableau 
Airbnb is a global online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts offering lodging in homes, apartments, or unique accommodations. Founded in 2008, it has revolutionized the way people book and experience accommodations, providing a diverse range of options in thousands of destinations worldwide. Airbnb has become a popular choice for both travelers seeking personalized stays and hosts looking to monetize their properties.

This Tableau Visualization and Dashboards project is based on the assumption that we're being hired by Airbnb's competitor company, as an independent consultant, to provide key insights via visualization and dashboards, into the New York City rental market of Airbnb.
